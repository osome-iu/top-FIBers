### Data sources
This project utilizes two data sources:
- The Observatory on Social Media's (OSoMe) Decahose infrastructure (soon to be killed, thanks to that big jerk Elon Musk)
- [CrowdTangle](https://crowdtangle.com/) (CT) via their [API](https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API/wiki)

### Data details
#### Both platforms
- Each month, we calculate [FIB indices](./fib_index.md) based on the previous three months of data
- These indices are utilized to identify and display the top 50 superspreaders and their posting activity

#### Twitter
- Tweets are in V1 format
- Tweets contain at least one low-credibility domain, as defined by the latest [iffy.news](iffy.news) list. 
    - We only consider sources that have a "low" or "very-low" MBFC Factual score
        - See [Media Bias/Fact Check Methodology](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/methodology/) for details
- During the monthly pipeline, decahose data is generated by `moe` and then saved here: 
    ```
    lisa.luddy.indiana.edu:/home/data/osome_swap/moe/jobs/top_fibers_data
    ```
- It is then immediately copied to the `lenny` project directory here: 
    ```
    /home/data/apps/topfibers/moe_twitter_data
    ```
- Next it is processed by the rest of the [pipeline](./code/overview.md)

#### Facebook

- We utilize the [`posts/search` endpoint](https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API/wiki/Search) with elevated access (up to 10k posts per request). 
    - This page also contains information on the format of posts returned by CT
    - The script that downloads data is: [`scripts/data_collection/crowdtangle_dl_fb_links.py`](https://github.com/mr-devs/top-FIBers/blob/2d076ea29ba5df11b848c0c033a3662fdfd0cfe6/scripts/data_collection/crowdtangle_dl_fb_links.py)
- The API key can be found on the `lenny` machine saved here:
    ```
    /u/truthy/.top_fib_CT_setup
    ```
    - The API key can also be accessed by logging into https://crowdtangle.com/ > selecting the "Top-FIBers" dashboard > clicking the "gear" icon in the top right > selecting the "API access" dropdown. This will display the current API key and also allow you to generate a new one.
- Details on the format of Facebook posts data can be found [here](https://github.com/CrowdTangle/API/wiki/Search).
