To run the code in the repository, you must first make sure that you are utilizing the correct virutal environment.
We utilize [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html).
The environment files are kept inside of the `environments/` directory.
You can activate by running the below code from the root of this directory:
```
conda environments/env_code
```

See the [conda cheatsheet](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/cheatsheet.html) for help with `conda`.
